### Notebook Description

This notebook contains a series of Python programs that showcase mathematical, algorithmic, and statistical concepts through practical implementations and visualizations. Below is an overview of its contents:

1. **Virtual Dice with Histogram**:  
   A simulation of a virtual dice that generates random rolls. The results are represented in a histogram displaying the distribution of outcomes.

2. **Sierpiński Triangle and Generalization for Any \( n > 0 \)**:  
   Generation of the famous fractal known as the Sierpiński Triangle, extended to allow configurations for any value of \( n \), revealing fascinating geometric patterns.

3. **Computation of Pi Digits with Histograms**:  
   Implementation of the Chudnovsky and Gauss-Legendre algorithms for the precise computation of \(\pi\)'s digits. Results are visualized using histograms that illustrate patterns in the calculated digits.

4. **Bayesian Classifier (Gaussian Naive Bayes)**:  
   A probabilistic classification model based on the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. This classifier is used for categorizing data using a statistical approach.
